    That night he had a stomach ache! The next day was Sunday again. The caterpillar ate through one nice leaf, and after that he felt better. Now he wasn't hungry anymore-and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore. He was a big fat caterpillar. He built a small house, Called a cocoon, Around himself.
